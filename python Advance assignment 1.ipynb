    "**Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, meaning it supports OOP as well as other paradigms. You use classes to achieve \n",
    "\n",
    "OOP.Python provides all the standard features of object oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP programs prevent you from repeating code because a class can be defined once and reused many times. OOP therefore makes it easy \n",
    "\n",
    "to achieve the “Don’t Repeat Yourself” (DRY) principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of OOP:-\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP language allows to break the program into the bit-sized problems that can be solved easily (one object at a time).\n",
    "\n",
    "The new technology promises greater programmer productivity, better quality of software and lesser maintenance cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP systems can be easily upgraded from small to large systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that multiple instances of objects co-exist without any interference,\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to map the objects in problem domain to those in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs which cannot be invaded by the code in other parts of the \n",
    "\n",
    "program.\n",

    "By using inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code and extend the use of existing classes."

    "**Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more \n",
    "\n",
    "namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object.attr where object is an instance or class object, Python searches \n",
    "\n",
    "the namespace tree at and above object, for the first attr it can find. Because lower definitions in the tree override higher ones, \n",
    "\n",
    "inheritance forms the basis of specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python searches for an attribute in an upward tree of attributes. it first searches for the attribute in its instance and then \n",
    "\n",
    "looks in the class it is generated from, to all super classes listed in its class header"

    "\n",
    "Object is created many times as per requirement but class is decleared once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created whereas Object is an instance of a class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. but for a class this doesnot happens.\n",
